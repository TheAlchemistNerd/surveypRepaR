feat: Initial commit of data cleaning R package

This commit introduces the first version of an R package designed to clean survey data.

The package provides a set of functions to perform a complete data cleaning workflow, including:
- Loading survey data from Excel files.
- Cleaning column names to be `janitor` friendly and then shortening them for SPSS compatibility.
- Trimming whitespace and removing empty rows/columns.
- Automatically detecting categorical variables and converting them to factors.
- Attaching original survey questions as variable labels for clarity.
- Saving the final cleaned dataset as an SPSS (.sav) file with labels preserved.
